This is a my collection with many interesting preset files for mobile navigation apps. It supporting most popular client apps: Locus, Osmand, Orux, GuruMaps, Alpine Quest. This files allows to connect new raster online-maps to moblie navigation apps.

You can also download these maps from [AnyGIS.ru](https://anygis.ru/Web/Html/Download_ru) download page.

For online data processing it uses the [AnyGIS Server](https://github.com/nnngrach/AnyGIS_server) utility.

If you have any suggestions what other sources of maps should be added to the collection (and what to remove), then write me an e-mail. It is desirable to attach a link to the page with the map of interest to the letter. And, of course, report bugs and inaccuracies on the site.
